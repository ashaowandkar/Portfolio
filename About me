 I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my bachloer's degree from the University of pune in 2022

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. I have 1 year of experience in manual testing.
